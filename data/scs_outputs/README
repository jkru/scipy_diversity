o????.dat: Output of parsing programs.  Format listed below.  Ideally,
 	   the "author text string" will be semi-colon separated
 	   authors with format "first_name last_name, optional
 	   affiliation", but life isn't perfect.

title of talk@author text string@gender class of first speaker@type of presentation@source of information

           The final line contains initial stats, with numbers of all
           presentations, female first author presentations, male
           first author presentations, and presentations without
           classification information.  The probabilities listed are
           the expected female fraction (along with number of female
           first author presentations, given this fraction), the
           probability of observing the female first author
           presentations given that expected fraction, and the
           probability of having more than the observed number.
